# Extraction pipelines vaccine hesitancy
### Repository for the Lagrange Scholarships Projects about Vaccine Hesitancy - Extraction pipelines  

__________________________
### Requirements

(here show requirements)

In this project, we developed a rule-based classifier able to extract information related to vaccination bahaviors and experiences. The items we tracked are (i) adherence to the recommended or alternative vaccination schedule and (ii) mentions of positive or negative experiences with adverse events following immunization (AEFI). The rules of the pipelines are based on a combination of keywords and syntactic roles in which these keywords occur in a comment.
